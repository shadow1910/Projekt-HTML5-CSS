			<h2>London Real: Inside the Shadow</h2>
			<p class="description">YouTube channel London Real has produced a free, authorized documentary-feature about six-time Mr. Olympia Dorian Yates.</p>
			<p>The documentary is hosted by Brian Rose, who through his London Real interview series has developed a relationship with Dorian Yates over the past several years.</p>
			<p>Dorian Yates discusses what became of his life when it all ended so abruptly. With one career-ending bicep injury, Yates went from the incredible high of being Mr. Olympia into forced retirement. The monk would turn party animal.</p>
			<p>Currently, Yates has created his own brand and taken the time to speak on issues such as steroid use, training philosophy, and life after bodybuilding. This interview with London Real is an excellent view into Dorian’s life and experiences.</p>
