		<p>Temple Gym was founded by Dorian Yates, it is based in Birmingham, England.</p>
		<p>Temple Gym is feasibly one of the most famous, hardcore weights gyms this world has ever seen.  Established in the early sixties, the gym in Birmingham was taken over by Dorian Yates, six times Mr Olympia best known for his Blood and Guts Workouts and HIT (High-Intensity Training) program, the Dorian Yates Temple Gym was where Yates built his monstrous physique and changed bodybuilding forever.  Temple gym, Birmingham is proud to continue to reflect the training standards and hardcore values instilled by Dorian Yates and later, his son Lewis Yates, providing a serious hardcore weights gym, with a fantastic, supportive atmosphere.</p>
		<p class="description">About Dorian Yates</p>
		<p>Dorian Yates is a professional bodybuilder who won the Mr Olympia title six consecutive times between the years 1992 to 1997.  With an abundance of Mr Olympia awards, Yates is the fourth highest ranking bodybuilder in the world, following Ronnie Coleman (8 awards), Lee Haney (8 awards), Arnold Schwarzenegger (7 awards) and Phil Heath (7 awards).  Yates is considered to be one of the top bodybuilders in modern history.</p>
		<p>Born in 1962 in Hurley, Yates moved to Warwickshire and was raised in the rural town of Staffordshire.  As a teenager, he and his family moved to Birmingham and in 1983 Yates started working out, beginning his successful career as a bodybuilder.  Remaining out of the public eye, Yates would hide out in the Dungeon of Temple Gym, Birmingham before emerging to unexpectedly appear at contests, going on to steal the show, earning himself the nickname “The Shadow”.  It was even reported he turned down offers of large supplement endorsement contracts and avoided interviews and televised publicity, so as to give full commitment to his training.</p>
		<p>Over the course of his professional career, Yates won 15 major contests and gained two second-place finishes, becoming arguably the most successful British bodybuilder of all time.  However, he was forced to retire from professional bodybuilding after suffering from chronic acute injuries, including torn biceps and triceps, that latter of which he received just three weeks prior to his final contest, the 1997 Mr Olympia, which he won despite his injuries.</p>
	    <p> In his training program, Dorian Yates created the Blood and Guts workout, applying a style of training known as High-Intensity Training, aimed at maximising muscle stimulation through short, high-intensity workouts, instead of the more traditional, longer workouts.  This style of training has been highly recommended and popularised by bodybuilding professionals such as Arthur Jones and Mike Mentzer.</p>
