			<h2>How did Dorian Yates built his wide and thick back?</h2>
            <p class="description">He used slow and controlled tempo with some seriously heavy weights..</p> 			
			<p>One of the best back workouts was created by a legendary bodybuilder, Six-times Mr. Olympia, Dorian Yates. It is important to note that this workout is almost strictly based on hypertrophy principles. Dorian’s workout program is set up with one working set.</p>
            <p>Working sets are the true training periods after your warm up. Some powerlifting style workouts will have 3-4 warm-up sets before they actually have a working set.</p>	
            <p>Traditionally, this style of training will only utilize 1-2 working sets and they are used to train the body to carry the heaviest load possible for the total reps.</p>
            <p class="description">Dorian Yates back routine:</p>	
            <p>Supinated grip Pulldown: 1 working set of 8-10 reps</p> 			
			<p>Barbell row: 1 working set of 8 reps</p>
			<p>Seated cable row: 1 working set of 8 reps</p>
			<p>Deadlift: 1 working set of 6-8 reps</p>
